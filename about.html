                    <p> Preeti and Rebecca met way back in middle school (shout out to Bishop Seabury Academy). They've been close friends throughout highschool,
                        college, grad school, and now adulthood. Even though they live on opposite sides of the planet (Amsterdam / LA), they remain besties. They're both Geminis so really there are four founders because twin signs rule biatch.

                    <p class="large">How We Started</p>
                    <p>Both Rebecca and Preeti are passionate about eating a healthy balanced diet. We also believe in the importance of eating a diet that won't harm the environment. Both Rebecca and Preeti decided to cut down their meat intake 
                        for both health and climate reasons. We understand that obtaining enough protein on a meatless diet is difficult, and probably the primary reason why people give up vegetarian life.

                    <p class="large">Our Belief System</p>
                    <p>We believe in eating sustainably sourced, ethically produced, environmentally friendly protein.</p>
                    <p>We understand that eating bugs isn't a vegan diet. But we also want to acknowledge that if you kill the bugs in your house, you might as well eat them.</p>
